Tools give you repeatable and fast builds by default.

- backend servers
- building databases/caches
- highly concurrent, distributed apps, although "hardcore" apps like highly time/clock sensitive stuff is not good for Go b/c GC pauses etc...
  - "cloud native"
  - Great for CLI utils
  - good library support
  - cross-compile support
  - static hermetically sealed binaries
  - "small" binaries (depends on the app)

Also some up and coming uses

- "small" footprint applications
    - Note: not talking about firmware
    - sometimes people run this embedded but the community isn't very big yet
    - More like small VMs in the cloud, rPi, etc...
    - Suitable for IoT applications
    - full-stack web dev (gobuffalo.io)
